        <seg id="2">The Delhi Metro has reached a major milestone in the Phase-4 work as it cast its first pier on the under-construction Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg corridor, officials said on Sunday.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The pier was cast at Keshopur on the elevated stretch between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.</seg>
        <seg id="4">"The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation took another important step forward in its Phase 4 construction work as the first pier of this phase of Metro expansion was cast on the Janakpuri West-R K Ashram Marg Metro corridor," the DMRC said in a statement.</seg>
        <seg id="5">This "major construction milestone" has been achieved, despite severe shortage of manpower and other logistical challenges because of the pandemic, officials said.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The average height of piers on this corridor is 10m.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, piers will be 20m high at Madhuban Chowk (crossing with Line 1) and 25m at Haiderpur Badli Mor where this line will cross Line 2.</seg>
        <seg id="8">At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the viaduct level is going to be at 28m, the highest in the history of Delhi Metro, the statement said.</seg>

        <seg id="10">Piers, in terms of civil engineering are vertical loadbearing structures which act as intermediate support for adjacent ends of two spans.</seg>
        <seg id="11">They form the vertical support structures on which the elevated metro viaducts stand.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Metro piers today dot innumerable road medians in Delhi through which elevated Metro corridors run.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Pier numbers are now important landmarks for addresses across the Delhi-NCR.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The air interdiction missions conducted by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new camp belonging to the armed gang headed by the bandit leader known as "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest area of Zamfara State.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Coordinator Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche said the airstrike, which also resulted in the killing of several armed bandits, was executed following Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports as well as series of confirmatory aerial surveillance missions.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Deposed former Central African Republic President Francois Bozize announced on Saturday his candidacy for the December presidential vote despite being under United Nations sanctions and subject to an arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity.</seg>
        <seg id="3">He made the announcement in a speech to a large crowd of supporters at a congress of his party, Kwa na Kwa (Work, Nothing But Work), in the capital Bangui.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The 73-year-old former general and army chief was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels from the north, plunging the majority Christian nation into a violent civil war and an acute and continuing humanitarian crisis.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"The country needs a man of experience, peace and conviction," Bozize said in the speech that criticised the tenure of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Bozize first took power after a 2003 coup and served 10 years as president before fleeing the country in 2013.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The new administration sought his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide, but has not moved to arrest him since he returned from exile late last year.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It is not clear how the warrant or foreign sanctions will affect his candidacy.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In January, Bozize said he would ask the UN to lift the sanctions imposed in 2014 over his alleged support for Anti-balaka Christian armed groups.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Touadera governs today with the support of a large UN peacekeeping operation with more than 13,000 troops and police.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Elected in 2016, he is expected to seek a second term in the election but has not yet confirmed he will run.</seg>

        <seg id="13">The government signed a peace deal in February 2019 with 14 armed groups, who typically claim to defend the interests of specific communities or religions.</seg>

        <seg id="2">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysian authorities said Sunday that they were searching for two dozen Rohingya refugees who are feared to have drowned after jumping off their boat off the northern resort island of Langkawi.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official with the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency, said initial police information showed that only one of 25 Rohingya men who jumped off the boat had managed to swim ashore.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The lone survivor sought help from police late Saturday and has been detained for further investigation, Zawawi said.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to a military crackdown, and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Muslim-dominated Malaysia has been a common destination of boats arranged by traffickers who promise the refugees a better life abroad.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Zawawi said two vessels and an aircraft were deployed in the search.</seg>
        <seg id="8">He said the agency will also alert local fishermen and authorities in neighboring Thailand to assist in the search.</seg>
        <seg id="9">He didn't provide further details on the boat.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Last month, Malaysian authorities detained 269 Rohingya refugees and found a body on board a suspected smuggling boat off Langkawi that they said had been intentionally damaged so it couldn't be turned back to sea.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency later said that the 269 were transferred from a larger vessel on which dozens of people were believed to have died and their bodies thrown into the sea.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia cannot accept any more Rohingya refugees as it struggles with an economic slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="13">But he said those already in the country will not be sent back out to sea.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Malaysia is home to over 2 million illegal immigrants as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers - including 101,000 Rohingya - who are registered with the U.N. refugee agency.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson dealt a blow to fans ahead of the close-season by revealing star attacker Wilf Zaha wants to leave the club.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Ivorian international has been at Selhurst Park for over five years and now looks set to depart, having previously been linked with the likes of Arsenal and Bayern Munich.</seg>
        <seg id="4">At age 27 it remains to be seen if that calibre of club are still interested in splashing out a large fee on him, particularly this summer with the economic uncertainty in the sport, after a campaign in which Zaha scored four goals and claimed five assists for a Palace side which failed to inspire.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Speaking post-match after the final day, Hodgson told TalkSport's Alex Crook to "watch this space" regarding Zaha's probable exit after acknowledging the forward has "made it clear" he sees his future away from the club.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The forward still has three years left on his current Palace deal and they last year suggested it would take £100m to prise him away from the club.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Hodgson's side wrapped up the campaign with seven straight defeats and a final-day draw, dropping to 14th place in the process.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Zaha himself netted just once between mid-December and the end of the season, a long-range strike in a defeat to Chelsea.</seg>
        <seg id="9">He was reported to have handed in a transfer request last summer in a bid to force a move away, but a bid didn't materialise to tempt Palace to sell.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In an apparent move to boost his chances of a departure, Zaha changed agents in January and his priority for the weeks ahead will clearly be to secure a move away.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Zaha was the player to feature for the most minutes in the Premier League this season for Palace and the only member of the squad under 28 years of age to play 1,100 minutes or more, pointing to the level of rebuild which might be required in the squad with the potential fee brought in for the No 11.</seg>

        <seg id="2">KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and rebel forces in war-torn eastern Ukraine have started preparing for a "full and comprehensive" cease-fire scheduled to begin at midnight, a move that officials hope can lead to more steps to resolve the 6-year-old conflict.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Rebel officials said Sunday they have instructed their troops about the cease-fire and issued a decree banning the use of weapons.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Ukraine's military said their forces "have begun preparations" for the ceasefire.</seg>
        <seg id="5">If upheld, it would "pave the way for implementing other clauses" of the Minsk peace deal, the office of Ukraine's president said earlier this week, calling the cease-fire a "breakthrough."</seg>
        <seg id="6">Brokered in 2015 by France and Germany, the Minsk peace plan aimed to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists that flared in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatists.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The conflict has since killed more than 14,000.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both commended the cease-fire deal in a phone call Sunday and underscored the importance of implementing the agreements reached at the December summit in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Russia President Vladimir Putin expressed concern over Kyiv's calls to revise the Minsk agreements and said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's "position about the non-alternative nature of the Minsk agreements, once again voiced during this call, should translate into real actions," the Kremlin said.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Zelenskiy in turn, stressed the need "for further practical steps" aimed at releasing Ukrainians who are imprisoned by rebels in eastern Ukraine, in the annexed region of Crimea and in Russia, according to a statement by his office.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The 2015 deal envisaged that Ukraine can regain control over its border with Russia in the separatist-held regions only after they are granted broad self-rule and hold local elections.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The accord helped reduce the scope of hostilities, but Ukrainian forces and the rebels have continued to exchange artillery salvos and gunfire.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In December, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris for another round of talks, expressing support for the Minsk deal and agreeing to revive the peace process.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Zelenskiy, who won the 2019 election on promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to get control of its border first before local elections, but the Kremlin has insisted the deal should be implemented without revisions.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The new cease-fire deal was reached Wednesday by members of the Tripartite Contact Group that includes representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and was welcomed by EU officials.</seg>
        <seg id="16">During his traditional Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis also commended the cease-fire, adding that it needed to be put into practice ″to rebuild confidence and lay the foundations for a much needed and long awaited reconciliation with the people.″</seg>

        <seg id="2">WASHINGTON (AP) - A nonpartisan Christian organization that seeks to end hunger said Saturday it asked for and received the resignation of Rep. Ted Yoho from its board of directors following what it called his "verbal attack" on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused Yoho, R-Fla., of using a vulgar and sexist insult while upbraiding her during a confrontation last Monday on the steps of the Capitol.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Yoho maintained he did not use the words cited, though a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed the language as she described it.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In a statement, Bread for the World said its board met Friday with Yoho and sought his resignation "as an action that reaffirms our commitment to coming alongside women and people of color, nationally and globally, as they continue to lead us to a more racially inclusive and equitable world."</seg>
        <seg id="6">On its website, Bread for the World says its "collective Christian voice" lobbies Congress and the administration on ending hunger nationally and worldwide.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"As a bipartisan Christian organization committed to alleviating hunger and poverty through sound public policies, Bread for the World upholds the values of respect, dignity, and compassion that Jesus calls us to when engaging decision makers from across the political spectrum," the statement said.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"We believe that Rep. Ted Yoho's recent actions and words as reported in the media are not reflective of the ethical standards expected of members of our Board of Directors."</seg>
        <seg id="9">A spokesman for Yoho did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In an extraordinary speech Thursday in the House, Ocasio-Cortez offered a dramatic account of the incident and broadened her remarks to assail what she called a sexist culture of "accepting violence and violent language against women."</seg>
        <seg id="11">More than a dozen colleagues joined her in casting the incident as all-too-common male behavior.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Yoho has described the encounter as a brief policy discussion and said that "no one was accosted, bullied, or attacked."</seg>
        <seg id="13">He expressed regret for his "abrupt manner."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a freshman progressive who has gained praise and criticism for her outspokenness.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Yoho, 65, one of the most conservative members of the House, is retiring at the end of his fourth term.</seg>

        <seg id="2">An FDNY diversity official has said that it's 'most definitely' acceptable to keep a white firefighter off a ceremonial color guard so the flag bearers could all be black, according to a new report.</seg>
        <seg id="3">White firefighter Lt. Daniel McWilliams filed a lawsuit claiming racial bias after he was removed from a flag-bearing unit at a November 2017 memorial mass honoring deceased members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternal society of black firefighters.</seg>
        <seg id="4">And FDNY's chief diversity and inclusion officer, lawyer Cecilia Loving, has defended the decision at a New York state Division of Human Rights trial, The New York Post reports.</seg>
        <seg id="5">McWilliams was one of the three FDNY firefighters seen in an iconic photo as they hoist the American flag at Ground Zero in the days after the 9/11 attacks.</seg>
        <seg id="6">According to McWilliams' complaint, he been selected by the FDNY Ceremonial Unit to serve as one of the flag bearers in the color guard at the memorial service.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Being a flag bearer at the event was an 'esteemed honor and privilege' for McWilliams, according to his lawsuit, CNN reported.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Upon his arrival at the event, however, McWilliams was barred from participating in the color guard by then-Vulcan Society president Regina Wilson because she allegedly had asked for an all-black color guard at the mass.</seg>
        <seg id="9">She then asked McWilliams - a 29-year FDNY veteran - to 'help in a different capacity.'</seg>
        <seg id="10">Among those duties was allegedly asking him to escort civilians and muster uniformed officers into formation away from the mass.</seg>
        <seg id="11">McWilliams claimed in his suit that he asked Wilson if she was removing him from the color guard because he's not black.</seg>
        <seg id="12">She confirmed that was the case, he said.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Wilson, a 21-year FDNY veteran who was also part of the 9/11 rescue efforts, apparently replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.</seg>
        <seg id="14">McWilliams claimed he left the memorial 'to save himself from further shame, humiliation and embarrassment,' as their exchange was overheard by friends and colleagues, the New York Daily News reported.</seg>
        <seg id="15">During her trial testimony, McWilliams' lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked Loving - who is black - 'So, a request for an all-black color guard is not discriminatory?'</seg>
        <seg id="16">'No, it isn't,' Loving said, according to the New York Post.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Sullivan also asked Loving if it's OK to request an all-black color guard, to which she was quoted as saying, 'Most definitely.'</seg>
        <seg id="18">By way of explanation, Loving said that it was OK to swap out a white person for a black person to 'uplift our identities and our separate ethnicities in order to instill a sense of pride and community and support for one another.'</seg>
        <seg id="19">McWilliams first filed his racial bias complaint with the FDNY in January 2018.</seg>
        <seg id="20">He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the FDNY, the city of New York and unnamed individuals in May 2019.</seg>
        <seg id="21">After filing his complaint, Sullivan said that McWilliams was retaliated against and intimidated by Wilson's supporters.</seg>
        <seg id="22">At one point, one of her supporters allegedly laid hands on McWilliams and said: 'I've heard about you, they told me you'd act this way, and now you know me.'</seg>
        <seg id="23">In a brief, Sullivan wrote that rejecting McWilliams from the mass' color guard position was 'deplorable' and a sign of double standards in the fire department.</seg>
        <seg id="24">'If you're black and you discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you get a slap on the wrist at best,' Sullivan wrote.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Wilson, according to the lawsuit, received 'one hour of counseling' over her treatment of McWilliams.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a person of color receives 'heavy-handed discipline and punishment,' Sullivan wrote.</seg>
        <seg id="27">'The FDNY has created a policy and procedure for bending over backwards, coming up with excuses and accommodating members of the Vulcan Society ... who commit racist acts, and it has to stop,' Sullivan also wrote.</seg>

        <seg id="2">BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its armed forces and is seeking to purchase more warplanes amid simmering tensions in the Balkans, the Serbian president said Sunday.</seg>
        <seg id="3">President Aleksandar Vucic said "certain initiatives" have been made to buy a fleet of fighter-bombers, accusing the U.S. and other Western countries of arming Serbia's NATO neighbors and its breakaway former province of Kosovo.</seg>
        <seg id="4">"The Americans, Turks and Germans are taking care of their beloved child," Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.</seg>
        <seg id="5">He said the U.S. has recently delivered a number of armored vehicles to Kosovo's security forces.</seg>
        <seg id="6">During a tour of a Serbian army tank brigade, Vucic said his country cannot compete with "NATO donations" to its neighbors when it comes to weapons, "therefore we must do it alone."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Vucic did not specify what type of warplanes Serbia plans to buy, but the pro-government media said his government has officially asked the U.S. for the delivery of 20 fighter-bombers.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The reports said Washington has not yet responded to Belgrade's request and that in case of a refusal, it is likely to purchase Russian-made Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Serbia, which claims military neutrality, has recently received a sophisticated anti-aircraft system from Russia, which has also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters and armored vehicles.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Another Serbian ally, China, has delivered military drones.</seg>
        <seg id="11">U.S. officials have in the past spoken openly about introducing sanctions against Serbia if Moscow sends more arms to the country, especially those that could jeopardize the security of neighboring NATO-member states.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The Russian and Chinese arming of Serbia is being watched with unease in the West and among Serbia's neighbors.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Tensions are growing in the Balkans, which went through a devastating civil war in the 1990s.</seg>
        <seg id="14">NATO intervened in Serbia to stop a bloody Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists in 1999.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Despite formally seeking to join the European Union, Serbia's populist leadership has further strengthened close political and military ties with the Kremlin, as well as Beijing.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Serbia, as well as Russia and China, don't accept Kosovo's independence, which is recognized by the U.S. and most of the West.</seg>

        <seg id="1">History focus can play an important role in reconciliation</seg>
        <seg id="2">Divides have deepened when understanding and healing should be our goals.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Our school system is partly to blame for this failure of knowledge and understanding.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Far too little Australian history is taught.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In fact, without radical action, the only school subject that focuses specifically on our history - "Australian history," at year 12 - will die within the next five years, maybe sooner.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Last year, of 49,324 Victorian students to complete the VCE, only 628, or 1 per cent, did Australian history.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Over the past six years, this figure has been almost halved, with almost 100 fewer students enrolling every year.</seg>
        <seg id="8">A key reason why so few students choose to study Australian history in year 12 is that little has been done in earlier years to fire their passion.</seg>
        <seg id="9">History is not even a standalone learning area, but is subsumed within the broader "humanities."</seg>
        <seg id="10">So across years 7 and 8, students complete only one short unit on ancient "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Then, in years 9 and 10, there is another unit focusing on Australia during the world wars.</seg>
        <seg id="12">For many Victorian students, that is the sum of Australian history taught across their secondary years.</seg>
        <seg id="13">At years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit covering the period from 1750-1918.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Three actions should urgently be taken to save Australian history in Victorian schools.</seg>
        <seg id="15">First, history must become a standalone learning area like English, maths and science.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Because history is taught only as part of the humanities, it is given little space within the curriculum.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It is also normally taught by humanities generalists who have not studied history themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Historical skills, such as the analysis of evidence, are complex.</seg>
        <seg id="19">We must recruit more specialist history teachers to make sure these are taught in an accessible and exciting way.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Third, the study of Australian history from 1788 to 1914 must become compulsory.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Students love familiarity.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So many of my former students decided against Australian history in year 12 because they would have had to learn the content from scratch.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Knowledge of our history alone will not bridge our deep racial divides.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But without it, as the Victorian curriculum makes clear, the task is hopeless.</seg>

        <seg id="7">Prince Andrew is preparing to fight back against the possible disclosure this week of further damaging allegations about his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.</seg>
        <seg id="8">US District Judge Loretta Preska last week ordered the release of 80 secret legal documents, running to hundreds of pages, relating to Maxwell and Epstein.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The publication of the vast tranche of papers would be a blow for Maxwell, 58, as they feature large sections of testimony she gave to lawyers in 2016, including what her legal team said was "intrusive questioning" about her sex life.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They could also heap pressure on Prince Andrew because one of the documents includes communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, an alleged sex slave of the shamed US financier, claimed in court papers that she was forced to have sex with the Prince on three occasions.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Andrew has repeatedly and strenuously denied the claims.</seg>
        <seg id="12">A leaked email from 2015 that was revealed last year by the BBC appears to suggest that Andrew asked for Maxwell's help in dealing with Ms Roberts's claims.</seg>
        <seg id="13">We have no doubt the Duke will be vindicated</seg>
        <seg id="14">In it, he told the socialite: "Let me know when we can talk.  Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts."</seg>

        <seg id="17">As the US courts have been at pains to point out, just because an allegation is included in court papers does not make them true.</seg>

        <seg id="19">We entirely concur.</seg>

        <seg id="22">She is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge in legal depositions of his abuse.</seg>
        <seg id="23">She denies all the allegations.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Maxwell was interviewed by lawyers in April and July 2016 as part of a defamation lawsuit brought by Ms Roberts, who now goes by her married surname Giuffre.</seg>
        <seg id="25">About 40 of 418 pages of that testimony were made public last year, but following last week's ruling by Judge Preska in New York, further sections could be unsealed as early as Thursday.</seg>

        <seg id="2">During his interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump questioned whether the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, could handle the barrage of questioning that Wallace posed to Trump.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The answer to that question - at least for now - we may never know.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Wallace on Sunday informed viewers that the Biden campaign told Fox News he was "not available" for an interview.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"In our interview last week with President Trump, he questioned whether his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, could handle a similar encounter," Wallace said.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"This week, we asked the Biden campaign for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available."</seg>
        <seg id="7">He added, "We'll keep asking every week."</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Trump campaign has hit Biden for months for abstaining from holding rallies and news conferences while continuing to do interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="9">While Biden recently has returned to the stump, Trump and his allies continued to mock the former vice president for "hiding" in his home in Delaware.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Biden's reticence to do public events, however, has done little to hurt his candidacy as the latest polls had Biden comfortably ahead of Trump both nationally and in key battleground states.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Real Clear Politics averages indicated the president was down 7 points in Florida, 6.7 points in Pennsylvania, 8.2 points in Michigan and 6.4 points in Wisconsin.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Trump narrowly won all four states in 2016, flipping them from blue to red as he won the White House.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The latest Fox News Polls put Biden ahead in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, with leads all outside the margin of error.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Polling also suggested Biden had a slight edge in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important swing states this cycle.</seg>
        <seg id="15">And, surveys indicated that once reliably red states such as Texas and Georgia were all knotted up between Trump and the former vice president.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Presidential elections in which an incumbent is running for a second term in the White House are often a referendum on that president - and that's seen as being the case right now in the 2020 showdown between Trump and Biden.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The top issues have been the coronavirus and an economy flattened by the pandemic - and the president's performance and record on both issues.</seg>

        <seg id="2">"The pandemic alone is a call to our elected officials for the type of leadership and vision we expect at a moment of crisis," says the report, which grew out of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, an author and expert on organizational development and executive leadership.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"But we are also facing another reckoning, one over our nation's original sin and the racial inequities that have beset our country since its founding."</seg>
        <seg id="4">The study ticks through familiar themes when it comes to assessing the sorry state of Congress: the lack of any real across-the-aisle relationships, a schedule that limits opportunities for interaction, too much power concentrated in leadership, constant fund-raising demands, discouragement of bipartisanship, the negative influence of round-the-clock media, the fact that the most important election for lawmakers is often their primary, and the shutting out of minority-party voices.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It also warns that the shifts toward a more virtual Congress as a result of the pandemic, such as a new system of proxy voting in the House that allows lawmakers to cast their votes without traveling to Washington, could exacerbate the existing problems.</seg>
        <seg id="6">If the idea of a remote Congress takes hold, the report suggests, it would be a serious setback to efforts to enhance bipartisan interaction.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"Because of the pandemic, Congress was forced to conduct much of its business virtually, and we certainly understand why," the report said.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"But as much as that may have been a necessity, it should not be interpreted as a virtue."</seg>
        <seg id="9">The document says Congress needs "more and not less in-person interaction among members of Congress.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They need to learn more about each other's districts, hold civil conversations aimed at finding common ground, build relationships of trust that can lead understanding and solutions."</seg>
        <seg id="11">In a week when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, was verbally assaulted without provocation by Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, and fellow Republicans ganged up on Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, in a hostile confrontation, the call for civility rang especially true.</seg>

        <seg id="3">He and his wife, a retired Methodist Hospital nurse who calls herself a "glass half full person," ran an online fanzine and attended Comic Con events years ago.</seg>
        <seg id="4">They gather weekly with their two daughters, son-in-law and 7-year-old grandson for jigsaw puzzles and fierce games of Uno.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"They are amazing nerds," Ms. Roman, 38, said of her parents.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Sheryl Roberts, 65, understood the perils of the pandemic - she had diabetes, asthma and heart disease, which could put her at higher risk.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Her husband had chronic lung disease and a stent to open a blocked coronary artery.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"We have been so careful, so very careful, and stayed away from people," Ms. Roberts said.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Her husband began working from home in the spring when Washington State, New York and then other areas around the country were hit hard.</seg>

        <seg id="5">Fleetwood told PA: "For me, and every past and present member of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green is monumental.</seg>

        <seg id="7">No one has ever stepped into the ranks of Fleetwood Mac without a reverence for Peter Green and his talent, and to the fact that music should shine bright and always be delivered with uncompromising passion."</seg>

        <seg id="2">The council said as well as being critical koala, squirrel glider and grey goshawk habitat, it was a key link between Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek bushland corridors.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The property developers have appealed the council's rejection in the Planning and Environment Court, arguing the development complies with City Plan 2014 legislation, would satisfy an unmet town planning and community need and could "be undertaken without any unacceptable impacts."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Strong community opposition persists over the proposed development.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The developers, while maintaing the proposal is fully compliant with the plan, argue it could be changed to avoid any non-compliance rather than refused.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The development as it stands involves several stages, including a service station, childcare centre and 39 townhouses.</seg>
        <seg id="7">More than 120 public submissions were made during the consultation period, most objecting to the proposal as too big and inappropriate for the site.</seg>
        <seg id="8">BCC opposition leader Jared Cassidy said the council needed to buy the land to protect koalas.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"[Lord mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting ratepayer funds in a developer court battle and buy this land to protect Brisbane's wildlife," Cr Cassidy said.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"This is one of the most significant pieces of habitat in the Mountain to Mangroves Corridor and is home to a large koala community."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Cr Schrinner this week said the council wanted to see the koala habitat on the site protected.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"We didn't believe the proposal was appropriate for the site," Cr Schrinner said.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"This, I understand, is now going through a court process and obviously we hope to see out of that court process a good, positive outcome which will see the habitat preserved."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Cr Schrinner said koala habitat mapping was a joint responsibility between the council and the state government, with the state government responsible for detailed koala mapping used by local authorities for assessing development applications.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The US government has made further attempts to force European firms to ditch the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, Welt am Sonntag reported, citing people familiar with talks on the issue.</seg>
        <seg id="3">According to the newspaper, officials from US Department of State, the Treasury Department, as well as the Department of Energy approached European contractors to make sure they fully understand the consequences of staying in the project.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Up to a dozen officials reportedly held at least two online conferences with representatives of the firms in recent days.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Speaking in a "friendly" manner, the US side stressed that it wanted to prevent completion of Nord Stream 2, observers of the online talks said.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"I believe the threat is very, very serious," one of them revealed to the German outlet.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Those threats are consistent with comments by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week, in which he warned that companies involved in the project had better "get out now" or risk facing penalties under Section 232 of the notorious Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).</seg>
        <seg id="8">Apart from Russia's energy major Gazprom, which is developing the project, five European companies have joined.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Those are France's Engie, Austria's OMV, the UK-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, as well as Wintershall and Germany's Uniper.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Speaking to Welt am Sonntag, the latter called US attempts to undermine the "important infrastructure project" a clear intervention into European sovereignty.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, meant to expand US sanctions on companies involved in installing Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.</seg>
        <seg id="12">According to one of the sponsors of the bill, the measures can target companies facilitating or providing vessels, insurance, port facilities, or tethering services for those vessels, as well as to those providing certification for Nord Stream 2.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Both European businesses and government officials have repeatedly decried US attempts to meddle in European energy policy by sanctioning Nord Stream 2, with some even calling on Brussels to work on countermeasures.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Moscow has also lambasted Washington's move, calling it unfair competition.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Earlier this week, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia will develop a new strategy for completion of the project if Washington proceeds with new punitive measures.</seg>

        <seg id="3">The 32-year-old penned a short-term extension to his contract to see out the season with the club but will join AS Roma on a free transfer upon the conclusion of the campaign.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Spain international, who arrived from Barcelona back in 2015, has played a bit-part role under Lampard this season with only eight Premier League starts and 21 appearances in all competitions.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The Blues boss confirmed Pedro's departure after the west London club sealed a top-four finish with a 2-0 win over Wolves, with the veteran coming off the bench for his final appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"Pedro has played his last game for the club," Lampard told Sky Sports.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"The lads have just pretty much serenaded him in the changing room and rightly so because of the career he has had generally and for this club.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"It was his last Premier League game, but the impact he has had here is huge.</seg>
        <seg id="9">I want to say a big thanks to Peds and wish him well as he goes forward.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Along with adding 2x optical zoom, the second lens allows the Pixel 4 to see in 3D; thus doing a better job of blurring the background in portrait mode than previous Pixel handsets, which relied purely on software to achieve this "bokeh" effect.</seg>
        <seg id="3">To establish the camera's credentials, Google brought legendary portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz on stage to talk about her experience shooting with the Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Machine learning is still a strong focus for every aspect of Google's new smartphones, relying on "computational photography" to improve its HDR+ mode by combining up to nine different images.</seg>
        <seg id="5">New dual exposure controls offer separate sliders for brightness and shadows, allowing users to preview HDR+ in real-time.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The phone also relies on machine learning for improved auto white balance and an enhanced Night Sight night mode, which is sensitive enough to capture the Milky Way in the night sky.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Beyond the second camera lens, the Pixel 4 introduces a Soli "radar chip" front sensor which recognises Motion Sense gestures, allowing users to skip music, dismiss timers, snooze alarms or silence their phone with a wave of their hand.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All Motion Sense computations run in the device rather than connecting to the internet, as does the improved Google Assistant, as the tech giant focused on both reducing response times and enhancing user privacy.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Google's continued push to make the most of its machine learning capabilities has also spawned a new voice recorder app which transcribes audio live, without sending data to the internet.</seg>
        <seg id="10">For now the app only supports in English, with more languages to come.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support the Google Stadia cloud gaming platform, which opens its doors on November 19 in the US but is yet to receive an Australian launch date.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Beyond the new Pixel handsets, Google also unveiled a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook and second-generation Google Pixel Buds.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Forecasters are predicting "catastrophic flooding" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna made landfall twice, bringing heavy rain and winds up to 90mph.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It came ashore on Saturday as a category one storm (the lowest of the five levels) and has now been downgraded to a tropical storm - but there could still be 15-30cm (6-12in) of rain on Sunday with 60mph winds.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Some areas have already reported getting up to 23cm (9in) of rainfall, including Cameron County, which borders Mexico.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Hanna was the opening hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic cyclone season, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield warned residents to stay alert, saying: "We're not even close to over at this point.  We're still expecting catastrophic flooding."</seg>
        <seg id="6">Texas has already been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Governor Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in the storm's path, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston and Brazoria.</seg>
        <seg id="8">He said: "Any hurricane is an enormous challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="9">This challenge is complicated and made even more severe, seeing that it's sweeping through an area that is the most challenged area in the state for COVID-19."</seg>
        <seg id="10">The first landfall happened at 5pm on Saturday, 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles south of Corpus Christi.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The second took place nearby in eastern Kennedy County.</seg>
        <seg id="12">More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without power on Saturday evening.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Emergency services in Corpus Christi have placed barricades near intersections so they are ready to use if streets flood.</seg>
        <seg id="14">In a tweet, President Donald Trump said his administration was monitoring Hanna, along with Hurricane Douglas, which was heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Resident Sherry Boehme, who lives along a beach in Corpus Christi, said the approaching storm had increased the anxiety she felt during the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The 67-year-old has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease.</seg>
        <seg id="17">She said: "It's almost like a double whammy to us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">I think it's made a lot of people nervous.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"We'll get through it.</seg>

        <seg id="1">'I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money...</seg>
        <seg id="2">I'm here to help people' - Chimaev after making history on UFC Fight Island - RT Sport News</seg>
        <seg id="3">Khamzat Chimaev is being hailed as a UFC star-in-waiting after making history on Fight Island, but the Russian-born fighter says he is not planning any ostentatious displays of wealth similar to the likes of Conor McGregor.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Chimaev overwhelmed Northern Ireland's Rhys McKee in their welterweight contest in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, finishing his opponent with a ground-and-pound barrage 3 minutes and 9 seconds into the first round.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The win ensured Chimaev etched his name into the UFC history books by claiming the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern era of the promotion, coming just 10 days after he defeated Britain's John Phillips in similarly destructive fashion - on that occasion at middleweight.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The 8-0 Chimaev pocketed a $50,000 Performance-of-the-Night bonus for his work against McKee and has firmly earned the attention of the MMA world, being tipped as 'Khabib 2.0' - a perhaps inevitable comparison given Chimaev displays a similar oppressive dominance to the UFC lightweight champ, and was born in Chechnya, which neighbors Khabib's own Dagestani homeland.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Despite the newfound fame and financial boost, the softly-spoken Chimaev said he would not be prone to shows of wealth along the lines of MMA money-man Conor McGregor or his boxing equivalent Floyd Mayweather Jr.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"I do this not only for me, I do this for everybody I can help.</seg>
        <seg id="9">I don't want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, to show my money or something like that.</seg>
        <seg id="10">I want to help people," replied Chimaev when asked on Fight Island about how he would spend his bonus.</seg>
        <seg id="11">One man he has gained the attention of is Conor McGregor teammate and arch Twitter protagonist Dillon Danis, who took to the platform to claim he could submit Chimaev "easily."</seg>
        <seg id="12">That drew a withering response from the fighter known as 'Borz' - or 'wolf' in his native Chechen - who said he would "smash Danis with his eyes closed."</seg>
        <seg id="13">Chimaev, who now fights out of Stockholm, Sweden, having moved to the country at the age of 19, may be modest in displaying his financial ambitions but is distinctly less shy when it comes to his fighting prospects.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"I can smash everybody...</seg>
        <seg id="15">How many fighters in the welterweight division?</seg>
        <seg id="16">I can smash all of them," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Give me 77 kilos (welterweight) champion, 84 kilos (middleweight) champion, I'm going to smash both of them, same day."</seg>

        <seg id="2">Jose Mourinho has helped Tottenham Hotspur start a new unbeaten run at home since the Premier League's restart, but he says making that home form more consistent would be easier with supporters back.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Spurs have taken 12 wins from their home fixtures this term, but were beaten four times - only one of the six teams above them lost more on home soil.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Portuguese coach says it's possible to build those important streaks while fans are absent, but would be easier with them present.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"We need to do it with the fans. Without them you can create a kind of fortress, but based on the tactical side of the game," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"But, I think with fans, you can do it in a much stronger way because you add the emotional side of the game that only your fans in your stadium can give to you."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Mourinho feels that achieving the kind of long unbeaten streaks on home soil which he enjoyed at Chelsea, or which Liverpool have built over the past three seasons, is becoming ever tougher as the opposition becomes stronger.</seg>
        <seg id="8">But it's also a crucial factor in determining whether sides achieve their respective objectives at the end of the season, particularly in close-fought or derby matches where a home atmosphere can make the difference.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"I think the Premier League is getting into a direction where these unbeaten records are something more and more difficult to achieve because of the level of the teams."</seg>
        <seg id="10">"But to be strong at home and to arrive at the end of each season with an important number of points in your pocket from home matches is very important."</seg>
        <seg id="11">"I think our recent results at home without the fans are important, but we need them back.</seg>
        <seg id="12">I can imagine that victory against Arsenal with the stadium full of Tottenham fans.</seg>
        <seg id="13">This is the kind of empathy that you can create step by step."</seg>

        <seg id="2">Paul Gallant has a new perspective on violent protests after mocking President Donald Trump in June for saying anarchists were burning and pillaging Seattle.</seg>
        <seg id="3">All it took was for the mayhem to come near the talk show host's home.</seg>
        <seg id="4">"I feel like I need to buy a firearm because this is clearly going to keep happening," Gallant said Saturday night on Twitter after coming home to see the Starbucks coffeeshop below his apartment complex "destroyed" by vandals.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"Enough is enough.  It looks like a block party down the street from me.  Really angry right now."</seg>
        <seg id="6">The reaction stood in stark contrast to last month, when Trump complained that Seattle's mayor was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"These liberal Dems don't have a clue," the president said.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"The terrorists burn and pillage our cities, and they think it's just wonderful, even the death."</seg>
        <seg id="9">Gallant, who co-hosts the 'Danny &amp; Gallant'show on Seattle's ESPN radio affiliate, tweeted in response: "Walked through it last night out of curiosity and saw no burning, pillaging or deaths.  Chill dawg."</seg>
        <seg id="10">Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building because explosives could be inside the damaged Starbucks.</seg>
        <seg id="11">He posted pictures of the damage, saying, "Great job a - holes," and noted that he'd also seen a fire a few blocks away.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"Zero clue what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."</seg>
        <seg id="13">The turnabout didn't go unnoticed, as conservatives ridiculed Gallant for his earlier view, tweeting messages such as "Just chill dawg," and "Huh, maybe Trump was right."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio host, said, "Guess we're finally doing that field trip we discussed."</seg>
        <seg id="15">Gallant acknowledged the humor: "Woke up to a bunch of people tweeting 'chill dawg' at me.  I laughed."</seg>
        <seg id="16">He said he stood by his earlier statement, as he had walked through the CHAZ autonomous zone created by anarchists and found it to be less bad than it was portrayed.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Then burning and pillaging actually happened," he said.  "Classic."</seg>

        <seg id="2">Ashok Gehlot said if necessary, Congress hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's home.</seg>
        <seg id="3">A day after leading a dharna at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said if necessary, the Congress MLAs will meet the President and hold a sit-in outside the prime minister's residence to settle the crisis in the state.</seg>
        <seg id="4">At a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP), Mr Gehlot indicated that the plan was to have a floor test to prove that the majority of Congress MLAs and allies are with him in the tussle for power.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"He said the government has the majority and wants to go to the assembly floor," a statement issued by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi after the CLP meeting said.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The CLP meeting was held at the hotel where the MLAs in the Gehlot camp are holed up for days.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"The chief minister asked us to remain prepared to stay longer at the hotel.</seg>
        <seg id="8">If required, he said, we would go to meet the President and would also hold a dharna outside the prime minister's residence," a party leader said.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The Rajasthan Governor must call an assembly session to let the Congress prove its majority, party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said, alleging that the BJP's conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government was now clear.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"The country is ruled in accordance with the law and constitution.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Governments are formed and run based on people's mandate.</seg>
        <seg id="12">BJP's conspiracy to topple the Rajasthan government is clear.</seg>
        <seg id="13">This is an insult to 8 crore people of Rajasthan.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The governor must call assembly session so that the truth comes before the country," Mr Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told Congress MLAs on Saturday that he was ready to go to the President of India to make sure that what he calls a "BJP conspiracy" to stall a test of strength does not succeed.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Mr Gehlot, who protested for hours at Governor Kalraj Mishra's home on Friday to press for an assembly session, held meetings with Congress MLAs and his cabinet on Saturday, after which a fresh proposal was drawn up and passed by the cabinet.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Mr Mishra had last night asked Mr Gehlot to re-submit the request for an assembly session, citing six objections.</seg>
        <seg id="18">This proposal will be sent to the Governor soon.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Mr Gehlot has accused the Governor of delaying the session because he is "under pressure" to stall his government's test of strength.</seg>
        <seg id="20">As Mr Gehlot met with his cabinet, a BJP delegation led by Rajasthan BJP leader Satish Poonia and Leader of Opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria met the Governor to discuss the COVID-19 situation in the state.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Poland's right-wing government says it will withdraw from a European treaty aimed at preventing violence against women.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Istanbul Convention is the world's first binding instrument to prevent violence against women but the Polish Justice Minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, described the text as "harmful" because it requires that schools teach children about gender from a sociological point of view.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Ziobro said over the weekend that on Monday he will begin preparing the formal process to withdraw from the treaty.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"This ideological element is linked to the imperative to change education in schools and outside of school programs, in terms of learning, attitudes, convictions of the young Polish generation of students to make, in our opinion, the false assumption that biological sex is archaic, and in fact everything comes down to the socio-cultural gender."</seg>
        <seg id="6">In Ziobro's opinion, the convention's articles concerning the education of children and young people as well as family relationships in the LGBT context are not acceptable.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"We also reject the LGBT element of promoting family relationships, a view propagated by activists from left-wing or homosexual circles who want to translate their beliefs into binding law," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Council of Europe said on Sunday it is "alarmed" that Poland is aiming to withdraw from the Convention.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In Warsaw on Friday, around 2,000 people including women's groups and other rights activists held a demonstration in front of the offices of Ordo Luris, a right-wing organisation that supports withdrawal from the convention.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"We will not be victims" they chanted.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Demonstrations were also held in other Polish cities.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Poland signed the Istanbul Convention for the prevention and combating of violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Two people were bit by coyotes near Oso Creek Trail along Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo Saturday morning, causing a temporary closure at the trail.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Laura Wittmer said she sees coyotes almost every morning when she's running and typically just tries to avoid them, but on Saturday morning, one came directly toward her and bit her on the leg.</seg>
        <seg id="4">As investigations continue into the attacks, the trail has been closed.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The City of Mission Viejo said in a tweet, "Today, 2 different parties reported coyote bites to a human.  MV Animal Services is working with the Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife on this matter and a section of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed.  Please be aware and vigilant when you are out where wildlife is prevalent."</seg>
        <seg id="6">Wittmer tried to fight the coyote off by hitting it with a water bottle.</seg>
        <seg id="7">She called 911 to get a ride to her car but was able to drive herself to the emergency room.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The coyote disappeared into the hills but officials are hoping to track it down and check it for rabies.</seg>

        <seg id="2">New research has pinpointed a certain indulgence may be good for the heart muscle.</seg>
        <seg id="3">What is it?  And how would it reduce the chances of a heart attack?</seg>
        <seg id="4">Researchers conducted a meta-analysis spanning five decades looking into coronary heart disease (CHD).</seg>
        <seg id="5">CHD - that also goes by the name of ischaemic heart disease - has three main symptoms: chest pain (angina), heart attacks and heart failure.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Other symptoms of the disease can include heart palpitations and unusual breathlessness.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"Chocolate contains heart-healthy nutrients such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyphenols and stearic acid which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol."</seg>
        <seg id="8">Good cholesterol, otherwise known as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), collects "bad" cholesterol - the kind that furs up the heart's arteries - and transports it to the liver.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In the liver, "bad" (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol is broken down and excreted from the body.</seg>
        <seg id="10">However, the new study doesn't examine portion sizes, or the type of chocolate enjoyed.</seg>
        <seg id="11">It's not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or some other cocoa confectionery.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The findings were based on previous research that concluded that consuming cocoa (found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It's believed by scientists the flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Vascular function refers to how effectively the blood delivers oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carries away waste material.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In regards to the new research, lifestyle factors weren't highlighted in the results.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Dr Alice Lichtenstein commented on the data, suggesting that those who admitted to eating chocolate may be more likely to have "a healthy body weight."</seg>
        <seg id="17">She added that they could "regularly engage" in physical exercise and be "less stressed."</seg>
        <seg id="18">She continued: "Each factor could independently impact on cardiovascular health."</seg>

        <seg id="2">Congresswoman Val Demings (D-Fla.) was not shy about her willingness to serve as vice president under a potential Joe Biden administration as well as her sincere appreciation for being considered for the role.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In a live interview with BlackPressUSA as part of its #FIYAH!  Live series, the esteemed member of the Congressional Black Caucus shared her history and the work ethic and commitment that has brought her to this point, stating, "You all know my history.  I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor in Jacksonville, Florida."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Demings served as one of seven House Impeachment Managers during the January trial of President Donald Trump in the Senate.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Regardless of the Senate acquittal, history will forever note that he is the fourth commander-in-chief to be impeached.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The former House Impeachment Manager, replied in a February interview with NPR from her Capitol Hill office, "Was it worth it?  Every day it has been worth it."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Adding, while the verdict was disappointing, Democrats had an obligation to pursue the case regardless of outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="8">During the interview, Demings made it clear that she objects to Trump commuting the prison sentence of Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress (among other felonies) as well as his pardoning of other felons convicted of similar crimes, stating, "The gall of pardoning your friends, those who lied and cheated to cover up for your wrongdoings."</seg>
        <seg id="9">Demings heads Biden's list of potential running mates along with CBC Chair Karen Bass (D-Calif.), former Georgia State Rep. Stacey Abrams, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois), Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and a few others.</seg>
        <seg id="10">She noted however, that just one person will decide who will run alongside Joe Biden this fall.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"That's Joe Biden."</seg>
        <seg id="12">Then, while laughing, she raised her hand to her lips in a mock whisper to those viewing the livestream, adding, "If y'all want to make a call... go ahead."</seg>
        <seg id="13">There's no doubt that regardless of one's political leanings, history will look back on this period as a season of evolution in American politics and perceptions.</seg>
        <seg id="14">This fact was not lost on Demings.</seg>
        <seg id="15">She noted that having so any women in consideration for vice presidential candidacy represents an opportunity to break through what remains of the glass ceiling - particularly when it comes to African American women.</seg>
        <seg id="16">"These are the exact opportunities that I work hard for all of my life to create for young boys and girls who may have been told they're the wrong color, don't have enough money, or are the wrong gender," she said.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The congresswoman pledged to make sure that the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign advertise and to work with the Black Press of America to get as many as possible out to vote.</seg>
        <seg id="18">"I will make a call to [DNC Head] Tom Perez and I will put this on the top of my list," Demings promised.</seg>
        <seg id="19">She agreed it should be done now, rather than later in the campaign.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Responding to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's suggestion that Trump might refuse to leave the White House if defeated, and a separate editorial stating that the president is positioning to pardon himself, Demings became animated, "To even suggest pardoning himself made me sick to my stomach."</seg>
        <seg id="21">"But who would ever do that other than Trump?</seg>
        <seg id="22">I think he hates the job.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It's not a job where you should be allowed to break the law and ignore the Constitution.</seg>
        <seg id="24">I think he hates the job, but he hates to lose.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I can see this president not wanting to leave the White House, but we have a way of taking care of that, and if that happens, I just want to be on the team that makes it happen."</seg>

        <seg id="2">In a Saturday ruling, Judge Dolly Gee appeared to make the upcoming deadline moot by saying that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't have to release children if the three ways outlined in her previous order can't be met.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But Gee also underscored in her order that ICE still has a duty to release children in a timely manner.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The three ways Gee had outlined included releasing families who are in ICE detention together, releasing children to a sponsor, or releasing families based upon a federal court order.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Shalyn Fluharty, director of Proyecto Dilley, an organization that offers legal services to families in detention, decried the move as allowing ICE to decide whether to continue keeping children detained.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"The bottom line for me is that kids are detained indefinitely and they have no way out unless ICE agrees to do it or families agree to be separated," Fluharty said.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Families are detained in three facilities run by ICE -- Berks in Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County in Texas.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Children at the facilities range from ages 1 to 17, according to lawyers and advocates who provide legal assistance.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Gee -- who oversees implementation of the Flores Agreement, which governs care of children in custody -- said in June that given "non-compliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules," it was imperative to transfer children out of the facilities.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There are 969 detainees in ICE custody with positive coronavirus cases who are under isolation or monitoring as of July 23, according to ICE.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Of those, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes and one in Dilley, two of the family detention centers.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Overall, there have been more than 3,700 confirmed cases in custody</seg>

        <seg id="2">They started dating on the set of White Lines, a drama about debauchery on Ibiza - but when Laura Haddock and her boyfriend Tom Rhys Harries went house-hunting last week, they cut an image of relaxed calm far from the hedonism of the party island.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The couple, who played brother and sister in the hit Netflix series, were spotted as they viewed a stunning Oxfordshire farmhouse, which is on the market for £1.2 million.</seg>
        <seg id="4">They arrived in a Range Rover driven by Laura, 34, wearing denim shorts and a white top, and were met by an estate agent who ushered them inside for a look around the five-bedroom home.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In White Lines, which was filmed last autumn, Laura played Zoe Walker, who discovers the seedy side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her DJ brother Axel, played by 28-year-old Tom.</seg>
        <seg id="6">News of their relationship only emerged earlier this month, less than a year after the collapse of Laura's six-year marriage to Sam Claflin, who starred in The Hunger Games films.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Together they have a son, four-year-old Pip, and a daughter Margot, two.</seg>
        <seg id="8">When they announced their split last August, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: "Laura and I have decided to legally separate. We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship and a deep respect for one another whilst we continue to raise our family together."</seg>
        <seg id="9">Laura and Sam first met in 2011 at an audition and Sam, who's also been in Peaky Blinders, described their marriage in 2013 as "easily one of his greatest achievements."</seg>
        <seg id="10">Before White Lines, Laura appeared in the first Inbetweeners film and last year's BBC crime-drama The Capture, playing lawyer Hannah Roberts.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Tom has appeared in the Inbetweeners sequel and Sky drama Britannia.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Mrs Rooney has asked David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy</seg>
        <seg id="4">After talks between WAGs failed, insiders are expecting dramatic showdown</seg>
        <seg id="5">Coleen Rooney has hired the celebrity barrister acting for Johnny Depp in his blockbuster libel case to represent her in the "Wagatha Christie" legal battle with Rebekah Vardy.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The Mail on Sunday understands that Mrs Rooney has instructed David Sherborne to fight claims she defamed Mrs Vardy with allegations that personal information was leaked from her private Instagram account to a newspaper.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The news comes days after documents submitted to the High Court claimed that Mrs Vardy, who is married to Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, suffered physical and mental anguish as a result of Mrs Rooney's allegations.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The papers say the 38-year-old mother of five "suffered from severe panic attacks and anxiety which manifested in being scared to leave the house," adding that Mrs Vardy, who was seven months pregnant at the time, "was taken to hospital three times... as she suffered anxiety attacks as a result of the post and the repercussions of it."</seg>
        <seg id="9">As well as representing Depp in his libel action against The Sun over allegations the actor was a wife-beater, Mr Sherborne, 50, is acting for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their privacy claim against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.</seg>
        <seg id="10">After mediation talks between the two WAGs failed, insiders are now expecting a dramatic courtroom showdown.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"If you thought the Depp trial was box office, don't underestimate this forthcoming WAG war," said a source.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"It really is war now.  Coleen will not back down, neither will Becky.  It will be sensational stuff."</seg>
        <seg id="13">Mrs Rooney claimed that someone using Mrs Vardy's Instagram account had leaked fake stories about her to a newspaper.</seg>
        <seg id="14">She was nicknamed "Wagatha Christie" after revealing how she had she spent five months slowly limiting the number of friends who could see her updates on Instagram stories until only Mrs Vardy's account remained.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Mrs Rooney claims she then posted a fake story on Instagram, which was later published in a red-top newspaper.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In her legal submission, Mrs Vardy, who has denied involvement, alleges that she was made to feel like a "scapegoat" after Mrs Rooney posted the allegations "in a calculated and deliberate manner that was designed to cause very serious harm and enormous distress."</seg>
        <seg id="17">But Mrs Rooney's team has challenged the claim, alleging that details of her anguish are a "PR exercise" that distracts from the facts.</seg>
        <seg id="18">A source said: "Becky's papers are a sideshow, it is all so spurious."</seg>
        <seg id="19">Mrs Rooney - who has four sons with former England star Wayne Rooney - is being represented by lawyer Paul Lunt, of Liverpool-based legal firm Brabners.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Mrs Vardy is with London company Kingsley Napley, but it is unclear if she has yet instructed a barrister.</seg>
        <seg id="21">A spokesman for Mrs Rooney declined to comment.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Gottlieb warns uncontrolled coronavirus spread in a community makes it "very hard to open" schools in fall</seg>
        <seg id="2">Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, warned Sunday it's going to be "very hard" for school districts to open for the upcoming academic year if there is uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus within their communities.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"For local school districts, I think they need to be looking at what is the spread within the community.</seg>
        <seg id="4">If you have uncontrolled spread within the community, it's going to be very hard to open against that backdrop." Gottlieb said on "Face the Nation."</seg>
        <seg id="5">With the fall semester set to begin in the coming weeks, the Trump administration had been urging school districts to open their doors to students for in-person instruction five days a week.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But the push from President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos comes as Mr. Trump warned last week the coronavirus crisis will likely "get worse before it gets better" and acknowledged school districts in hot spots may have to delay reopening for a few weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance Thursday for how best to safely open schools for students.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The guidance calls for schools to follow social distancing, recommend students and staff wear face coverings, and keep students in defined groups to reduce contact with others, among other guidelines.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But the CDC did not provide a benchmark for school administrators on when they should move to close a school in the event of an uptick in coronavirus infections, which Gottlieb said was "unfortunate."</seg>
        <seg id="10">"In the setting of uncertainty and the lack of specific guidance for how to keep schools open, I think more parents are going to err on the side of caution," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"That's why it's very important to get specificity out of what the hard metrics are that the CDC didn't do in its guidance."</seg>
        <seg id="12">Gottlieb said school districts should think about positivity rates in their community, local spread and testing capacity to guide decision-making on whether to keep a school open or shift fully to online learning.</seg>
        <seg id="13">A positivity rate between 5% to 10%, he said, is "starting to get iffy," while above 10% is the "threshold where you really want to think carefully about closing the school districts."</seg>
        <seg id="14">"That is a sign that there is an epidemic underway inside that community," Gottlieb said, adding that it's going to be difficult for parts of Florida, which is an epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the U.S., to open their schools for in-person learning next month.</seg>
        <seg id="15">More than 30 states and the District of Columbia are experiencing an uptick in coronavirus infections, with the epicenter of the epidemic currently in the Sun Belt.</seg>
        <seg id="16">But Gottlieb said there are indications cases in some states including Arizona and Texas are beginning to plateau.</seg>
        <seg id="17">While Gottlieb said there are "unmistakable signs" the epidemic is slowing in some states across the Sun Belt, it's "heating up" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Many governors have instituted mandates requiring people to wear masks when they are in public spaces and halted their phased reopenings in an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Gottlieb said states should consider shutting down bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie theaters and other kinds of indoor entertainment venues, and implementing mask mandates to quell the epidemic, steps that allow states to stop short of reverting back to the more stringent restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic in March.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In addition to states issuing mask mandates, a number of businesses are requiring customers to wear face coverings as well.</seg>
        <seg id="21">McDonald's is among the latest to require face coverings, and the fast food giant joins Walmart, Starbucks and others in implementing their own rules for masks.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Gottlieb said he expects more businesses will implement mask mandates in venues, especially those considered high-risk.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"If we really can manage to keep the epidemic under control heading into the winter until we get to a vaccine or some kind of therapeutic that changes the clinical trajectory of this illness, just with masks that's going to be something relatively simple that we can all do that doesn't really change our lives and allows us to maintain what's really important to us like keeping some businesses open, like getting our kids back to school," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="24">While Mr. Trump has said he will not impose a nationwide mask mandate, he urged Americans last week to wear coverings, saying during a White House press briefing "they have an impact."</seg>

        <seg id="2">"We've really listened, and it was a really key thing in formulating this program," Ms Ronson said.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"We don't think people will want to recycle the books - we think they'll want to keep them, but they can recycle them at home if they wish to."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Ms Ronson said the new campaign had been in the works long before the onset of COVID-19, and despite the pandemic, she believed the timing was "quite good" for a new campaign given the amount of time parents were spending with their children.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Analysts had been concerned shoppers were tiring of the constant collectibles campaigns from major supermarkets, but Ms Ronson said there was no sign of fatigue just yet.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"We're not seeing any of that so far, but we do constantly look out for it," she said.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"We analyse a lot of data, week to week, month to month, to make sure we're launching things that really resonate with the customer base."</seg>
        <seg id="8">Collectible campaigns such as Little Shop were primarily pioneered by Coles in Australia, with the first iteration launching in mid-2018, fuelling one of the supermarket's best-ever single-quarter sales results.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Woolworths has since followed suit with its Lion King Ooshies campaign, which also helped the supermarket supercharge its sales, and most recently, its eco-friendly Discovery Garden promotion, which offered customer free herbs and flowers to plant.</seg>
        <seg id="10">However, with UBS analysts predicting Australia's supermarket sector to have COVID-inflated sales through much of the 2021 financial year, the impact of Coles' new collectibles could be far more muted this time.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Ms Ronson said customers could expect more varied and diverse forms of collectibles campaigns into the future, with promotions such as Little Shop likely to appear less often.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"There's a lot of these collectible-type campaigns to look to around the world, and we're constantly drawing inspiration from overseas," she said.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"We should be doing those sorts of things to make sure we're constantly raising the bar with our own customer base."</seg>

        <seg id="6">Police said 45 people were arrested while 21 officers were injured.</seg>

        <seg id="2">KANSAS CITY, Kan.  (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a stock car racing dynasty that includes father Lee and brother Richard and the first engine builder to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, died Saturday.</seg>
        <seg id="3">He was 81.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Petty's family did not disclose the cause of death.</seg>
        <seg id="5">No funeral arrangements have been announced.</seg>
        <seg id="6">While other family members were acclaimed for their ability behind the wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Chief" for his ability to turn a wrench.</seg>
        <seg id="7">He helped his family win 198 races and seven championships in NASCAR's premier series, and he also built engines that carried Hall of Famer Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton to victory.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"The Chief was one of the most talented mechanics in NASCAR history," chairman and chief executive Jim France.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"He provided the power that helped Petty Enterprises define dominance in sports.</seg>
        <seg id="10">While he was known for his work under the hood, Maurice played multiple behind-the-scenes roles, doing what it took to help deliver his cars to victory lane."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Maurice Petty was born March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.</seg>
        <seg id="12">He would tail his father to the track while growing up, and his mechanical know-how soon played an integral part in Lee Petty winning 54 races and three championships.</seg>
        <seg id="13">He made 26 starts in the NASCAR Cup Series from 1960-64, finishing in the top 5 seven times with 16 top-10 runs.</seg>
        <seg id="14">But he quickly decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than what happened behind the wheel, and that proved to be a good move for his older brother, who would rely on his engines during his period of dominance.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Richard, who would take on the nickname "The King," won his first championship along with The Chief when he drove a Plymouth to the 1964 title.</seg>
        <seg id="16">They won again in 1967, back-to-back titles in 1970 and "71, and added three more before the 1970s drew to an end.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The seven titles remains tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the most in history.</seg>
        <seg id="18">"Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers in NASCAR who helped build one of NASCAR's dominant teams in Petty Enterprises," Hall of Fame executive director Winston Kelley said in a statement.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Although the record shows 212 victories, Petty has well over 250 wins to his credit considering all the engines he built for his competitors.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Chief will forever be remember as one of the best to build power plants in NASCAR."</seg>
        <seg id="21">Lee Petty died in 2000 and Maurice Petty's wife of 52 years, Patricia, died in 2014.</seg>
        <seg id="22">He also was the uncle of former driver and broadcaster Kyle Petty and Truck Series crew chief Trent Owens.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"While we have lost one of NASCAR's true, gritty pioneers and heroes, Maurice Petty's legacy and memory will always be remembered, preserved, celebrated and cherished," Kelley said.</seg>
        <seg id="24">"We offer our sincere condolences to the Petty family."</seg>

        <seg id="4">Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was hunting when the angler emptied the bottle and launched it, hitting the animal on the back.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Mr Kenny called it "appalling and inconsiderate behaviour."</seg>
        <seg id="6">He said he was collecting litter at the Devon beauty spot with members of the Seal Project conservation charity when he witnessed the attack on Sunday morning.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"The seal made an attempt to get the fishing line," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"The angler finished his beer, drained the bottle and threw it at the seal.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"The bottle hit the seal on the back and it swam off."</seg>
        <seg id="10">Mr Kenny said that "fortunately seals are robust creatures," but said the seal was simply doing what was in its nature.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"By throwing a glass bottle at it you are stopping it from hunting," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The Seal Project said it was "not an isolated case" and it had received "numerous reports of this aggressive behaviour recently."</seg>
        <seg id="13">In a Facebook post, it said volunteers had collected 12 bags of rubbish during Sunday's visit to Hope's Nose and observed "multiple examples of antisocial behaviour."</seg>
        <seg id="14">All seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and people are advised to stay away from them.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Tory MPs accuse union chiefs of wanting civil servants to 'stay at home forever' after defying Boris Johnson's call for them to get back into the office</seg>
        <seg id="3">Union chiefs were last night accused of wanting staff to "stay at home forever" after defying Boris Johnson's clarion call for workers to get back to the office.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Tory MPs reacted with anger after the Public and Commercial Services Union told their members to challenge bosses who ordered them back to their desks.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Former Minister Andrew Percy said it was "unacceptable" that vital public-sector work such as issuing passports was going undone while private employees had toiled to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"It's unacceptable for them to refuse to come back to work while people in distribution centres and factories around the country have continued to go to work to feed civil servants during this period," he said.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"Many of those workers would now like a holiday and can't have one because of this refusal to go back to work in offices which can be achieved safely.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"The union chiefs cannot have a policy of stay at home forever - especially not now that we know people can return to work safely."</seg>
        <seg id="9">Following the Prime Minister's call, Alex Chisholm, the Civil Service's new chief operating officer, last week told all ministries that it was time to "change the default that civil servants should work from home and accelerate the return to the workplace from August 1."</seg>
        <seg id="10">But the Public and Commercial Services Union told its 200,000 members they did not have to accept that guidance, claiming it was a political issue.</seg>
        <seg id="11">A spokesman for the PCS, Britain's largest civil service union, said the back-to-the-office demand "is not based on our members" health and safety, or on helping our economy.</seg>
        <seg id="12">It is based entirely on political pressure being exerted by some Tory MPs who are demanding that the Civil Service is used as an example to get everybody back to work.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"Our advice to members is clear: if you are working from home and you get approached by anyone in your department asking you to now go back to work, don't just accept that's what you have to do."</seg>
        <seg id="14">The dispute comes amid growing concerns over delays to passports caused by home-working, with more than 400,000 people now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The Home Office has now said it will "seek to expedite" applications from Britons due to travel within the next 14 days and who have been waiting on the Passport Office for more than four weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The PCS has admitted that some people are having to wait for as long as 143 days for passports but insists that "small and often cramped offices" make social distancing difficult for the Passport Office's 4,000 staff.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Former Cabinet Minister David Davis urged civil service union chiefs to "behave responsibly" and work with the Government to find way of getting people back to their workplaces.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He added that if he was in Government, he would be asking union leaders: "What are you suggesting? That you stay [at home] all summer?"</seg>
        <seg id="19">However, Mr Johnson's plea to get people back to their offices has also gone unheeded by some of Britain's top firms.</seg>
        <seg id="20">A study of big employers with a total of 400,000 staff between them found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to the workplace.</seg>
